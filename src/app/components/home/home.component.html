  <h4>
    About the application:
  </h4>
  <p>
    This application is an Angular based web client for balldontlie.io open API.
    The application uses Angular HttpModule and consumes the following APIs:
  </p>
  <div>
    GET /players
  </div>
  <div>
    GET /players/:id
  </div>
  <div>
    GET /teams
  </div>
  <div>
    GET /teams/:id
  </div>
  <div>
    GET /games
  </div>
  <div>
    GET /games/:id
  </div>
  <div>
    GET /stats
  </div>
  <div>
    GET /season_averages
  </div>
  <p>
    The application compiles SCSS styles. Bootstrap 4 library is used for additional styling - buttons, inputs, tables, navigation and etc.
    There is implemented navigation component using Angular Router. Some of the components (for players and games) implement paging functionality.
    Going through pages triggers rest calls to the API, which support pagination.
    The user can track different information regarding NBA league. Possible options are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>view teams</li>
    <li>search players</li>
    <li>view players stats for different seasons</li>
    <li>view finished and ongoing games</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Angular application is finally deployed to Cloud Foundry via MTA deployment.
    Additional bash script is added, which installs the dependencies, builds the angular project to static files and performs MTA deployment.
  </p>
